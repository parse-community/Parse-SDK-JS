/**
 * Creates a new LiveQuery Subscription.
 * <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter">cloud functions</a>.
 *
 * <p>Response Object - Contains data from the client that made the request
 * <ul>
 * <li>clientId</li>
 * <li>installationId - requires Parse Server 4.0.0+</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Open Event - When you call query.subscribe(), we send a subscribe request to
 * the LiveQuery server, when we get the confirmation from the LiveQuery server,
 * this event will be emitted. When the client loses WebSocket connection to the
 * LiveQuery server, we will try to auto reconnect the LiveQuery server. If we
 * reconnect the LiveQuery server and successfully resubscribe the ParseQuery,
 * you'll also get this event.
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('open', (response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 * <p>Create Event - When a new ParseObject is created and it fulfills the ParseQuery you subscribe,
 * you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is created.
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('create', (object, response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 * <p>Update Event - When an existing ParseObject (original) which fulfills the ParseQuery you subscribe
 * is updated (The ParseObject fulfills the ParseQuery before and after changes),
 * you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is updated.
 * Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
 *
 * Parse-Server 3.1.3+ Required for original object parameter
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('update', (object, original, response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 * <p>Enter Event - When an existing ParseObject's (original) old value doesn't fulfill the ParseQuery
 * but its new value fulfills the ParseQuery, you'll get this event. The object is the
 * ParseObject which enters the ParseQuery. Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
 *
 * Parse-Server 3.1.3+ Required for original object parameter
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('enter', (object, original, response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 *
 * <p>Update Event - When an existing ParseObject's old value fulfills the ParseQuery but its new value
 * doesn't fulfill the ParseQuery, you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject
 * which leaves the ParseQuery. Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('leave', (object, response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 *
 * <p>Delete Event - When an existing ParseObject which fulfills the ParseQuery is deleted, you'll
 * get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is deleted.
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('delete', (object, response) => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
 *
 *
 * <p>Close Event - When the client loses the WebSocket connection to the LiveQuery
 * server and we stop receiving events, you'll get this event.
 *
 * <pre>
 * subscription.on('close', () => {
 *
 * });</pre></p>
