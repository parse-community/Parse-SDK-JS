**We use GitHub Issues for reporting bugs with Parse JS SDK.**

If you have a code-level question, use Stack Overflow with tags `parse-platform` and `parse-javascript-sdk`

If you have a non-bug question, you should join the [Parse Community's Discourse forum](https://community.parseplatform.org/c/sdk/js).
